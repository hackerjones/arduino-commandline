Command line processor for Arduino Streams
===========================================

The command line processor library consists of the CommandLine class.
When attached to a Stream object it will work similar to a unix or dos 
command shell. The user must supply a call back function which is called
by the processor when a complete command line is assembled. The list of 
arguments is passed via the (argc,argv) calling method similar to that
of a desktop C application's main function.
